## Four Samyak Grants. 
(Satara Samyak Pradhan)

Our great Buddha preached four practices that should be practiced if one wishes to attain Nirvana.

These are known as the four Samyak grants. By engaging in these frequently, Nirvana is opened, and the mind becomes more and more trained. These four points were also included in the Sath thes bhodhi pakshika dhammas preached by our Buddha because of their great importance. 

The main advantage of this is to be freed from the five hindrances (pancha nivarana) that block the path to Nirvana.

Our Buddha preached that the four main elements are weakened by the five prevention method (pancha Nicaea) and when implemented, the main obstacles to the path to nirvana can be removed.

You who cultivate the path must think wisely about this. Then the path will always grow.

# 01- Improvement of birth merits
 
We are inspired to continue the merits we are doing as well as to make merits that we have not been able to do so far.

Our great Buddha said that the desire to do meritorious deeds and the increase of effort, the heart always rests in the great human virtues such as love, kindness, mercy, and intimacy will lead to prosperity in both worlds.

One should be able to see with wisdom that the path to nirvana becomes easier for those who see the results of experience.

# 02- Generating unborn merits.

This can be described as an extremely important action in Nirvana. Here, according to the advice of Kalyanamitra, he is motivated to do meritorious things that he had not thought of doing until now.

Here, the mind is full of pure and high human dharma, so there is no room for evil or for the mind to become dirty.

The Buddha said that it is necessary to inquire wisely about this because that mind path is very helpful for those who cultivate the path of Nirvana.

# 03- Removal of birth defects.

Being able to recognize that what has arisen in one's mind is an evil mind is a skill. A conscious person can easily identify it.

As soon as he recognizes the evil mind, he thinks to get rid of it. Tactics are used for that. Increases effort. At last evils are freed from the mind.
By remembering the troubles and sufferings he has to experience due to the evil mind, he becomes interested in freeing himself from the evil mind.

As soon as you see the evil mind, happiness is born in the heart. One can be described as the triumphant joy of having identified the enemy.

There is pure happiness in the heart when the strategies used to get rid of the evil are successful. In experiencing that happiness, there is a need to keep that happiness in the mind. 

Our great Lord Buddha preached that it is something that the sages should follow as it inspires them to complete Nirvana.


# 04- Avoiding unborn evil.

A mind that is well balanced between merit and demerit is an alert mind.

A conscious mind. Knowing the dangerous nature of the bad results caused by vices, the mind is never prepared to bow down to vices.

It is known that by having to bear the consequences of bad deeds, one has to face severe sufferings. It is a great help to cultivate the way to get the bad habits in the company of Kalyanamitra.

The Buddha's teaching is that the disciple should be able to overcome the path by weakening the mind of anger, hatred and delusion.
