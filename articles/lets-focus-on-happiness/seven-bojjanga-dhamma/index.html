By following these seven elements, it is easy to reach the path. It helps to break the bonds attached to the Sansara.</p><p>Buddha preached that there are three bodhis, these bodhi elements should be practiced well to get the titles of Buddha, Pasebudha, and Maharath. For that, you need to get a special understanding of how the mind works. There must be wisdom for that.</p><h1 id=01--sati-sambojjanga>01- Sati Sambojjanga</h1><p>Humans believe that because of something or someone from the outside, lust, hatred, and delusion conflicts arise in the heart. Therefore, they always look for comfort in the external environment. They are known as Asruthavat Prutagjana.</p><p>The disciple who aims for Nirvana was very careful about how his mind behaves.
They are called Sruthavat Arya Sravaka.</p><p>The noble disciple sees clearly every thought that comes to his mind. Identify the nature of the thought. Able to prevent thoughts that block the path to Nirvana. Only thoughts worthy of Nirvana are maintained.</p><p>A gatekeeper in a city knows the details of those coming and going to the city. Arya Shravaka has the ability to intelligently inquire into every thought that comes to mind.</p><p>Sati Sambojjanga prepares the mind for nirvana by removing the defilements of lust, hatred and delusion.</p><p>The functioning of the six senses is completely subordinated to the mind. The behavior of the senses is free from impurities. It is a grant element that opens the door to Nirvana. By practicing this well, the six senses automatically stop responding to external signs.</p><h1 id=02--dhamma-vichaya-sambojjanga>02- Dhamma Vichaya Sambojjanga</h1><p>The noble disciple who hopes for Nirvana is enlightened to inquire into Dharma. He knows the root of lust, hatred and delusion that exists in him as an association and a companion.</p><p>Arya Shravaka has the ability to analyze how impurity dharma is born in the mind and the dangers of bad reactions caused by its existence in the mind. ( Adinawa) He knows the method of removing lust, hatred and delusion and has the will and effort to implement it. Thus, a commitment is built from within.</p><p>See the extent to which the filth in the mind of the Arya Shravaka has been removed so far. The remaining amount to be removed is also seen.</p><p>Wisdom sees the accumulation ( Samudaya) of impurities in the mind. Ignorance is seen as the source of suffering in lust. Thus Samudaya sees that karma, food, leads to Nibbantya Sansara and strives to destroy ignorance and craving.</p><p>The elimination of impurities is called Nirodaya. Dhamma Vichaya Sambojjanga practice must be done for Nirodaya and it must be remembered that it is one of the main keys to open the door of Nirvana.</p><h1 id=03---virya-sambojjanga>03 - Virya Sambojjanga</h1><p>Arya Shravaka who is interested in Nirvana takes the help of Kalyanamitra and engages in mind training. Primarily, four Samyak Grants are improved here.</p><pre><code>01- Removal of birth defects. (Prahana Grants)
02- Not doing unborn evil. (Sanwara Pradana)
03- Increasing birth merits. (Anurakkana Grants)
04- Cultivating unborn merits. (Meditation grants)
</code></pre><p>When virya develops in four ways, good discipline develops in him. Panchadvara does not cause evil, so there is always a meritorious mind. Although the Panchdwara is not functioning, the Manodwara can be seen to be functioning continuously.
Realize that the thoughts in the mind are very large non-stop products. Know that it is out of control.</p><p>A disciple who is situated in the virtue of the senses handles the five senses with wisdom and awareness. Do not manipulate by inspiration. Loves living in beautiful solitude.</p><p>Leaving the Panchadwaras and being in the Manodevara, one sees that its thoughts are arranged in two ways.</p><pre><code>01- Kama vithakka, Vyapada vithakka, Vihinsa vithakka problems occur when virya effort and commitment are at a very low level.

02- Nekkamma vithakka, Avyapada Vithakka, Vihinsa vithakka disputes arise. Dedication, effort, virya and interest are at the highest level.
</code></pre><p>In order to satisfy the five senses, efforts should be made to protect the mind from thoughts of lust, hatred and delusion by weakening the mind&rsquo;s ground to receive images, sounds, smells, tastes and touches.</p><p>One should make every effort not to take in, nourish, and maintain in the mind negative thoughts through the five senses.</p><p>Vihinsa vithakka - The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking others suffer for fun is frowned upon. A mind free from such wicked and sinful thoughts should exist.</p><p>Our great Buddha preached that in order to reach
Nirvana, one should practice Virya Bojjanga by completing the above process well.</p><h1 id=04---preethi-sambojjunga>04 - Preethi Sambojjunga</h1><p>The mind of the Arya Shravaka is filled with joy when he fulfills Sati, Dhamma Vichaya and Virya Sambojjanga.</p><p>A pure heart is always happy. Since the undefiled mind is as clear as a white cloth, there is a gentle and beautiful nature. No cleaning required. This is a great nature of mind. It is called meditation. It is pleasant to live here. This is the nature of meditation (Diyaana) that our Buddha described as maintaining the mind.</p><h1 id=05---passadhi-sambojjanga>05 - Passadhi Sambojjanga</h1><p>Sati, Dhamma Vichaya, Virya, Prithi Sambojjanga are the lightness that arises in the mind when completed respectively.</p><p>This ease is constantly present in the mind. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard to maintain. It arises and exists by itself. This is also a higher nature with purity of mind. This also belongs to Dhyana features. Our Buddha preached that the mind becomes relaxed as a result of the practice of Arya Shravaka.</p><h1 id=06---samadhi-bojjanga>06 - Samadhi Bojjanga</h1><p>Sati, Dhamma Vichaya, Virya, Preeti, Pasaddhi Sambojjanga are all successively the concentration of the mind.</p><p>The meditations of vitakka, vichara preeti, suka, ekaggata are evident in the peaceful mind. A still mind arises. Here, the four transcendental meditations begin to grow.
First Dhyana, Second Dhyana, Third Dhyana and Fourth Dhyana. Samadhi Bojjanga helps to attain a transcendental experience of the mind.</p><h1 id=07---upekka-sambojjanga>07 - Upekka Sambojjanga</h1><p>The infinite nature that arises in the mind after applying the above six forms of Bojjanga Dharma. This is the nature that always exists in the four postures. The mind shines because of having a pure heart. Tranquility is maximum in Panchadwara and Manodwara.</p><p>Our Buddha said that this is a ladder for the noble disciple to reach Nirvana.By developing the practice of satta bojjanga one must be able to harness the amazing power of the mind.</p><p>Sadhu sadhu sadhu
