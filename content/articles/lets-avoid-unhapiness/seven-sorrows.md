As a result of this, restlessness of the mind, loss of appetite, anger, restlessness, etc., make the mind unable to enjoy the normal life.

There are 04 sufferings after achieving the goal.

# 06- Fear of losing what has been gained.

The fear, doubt, and uncertainty of when the hard-earned thing will be taken away from one's right always makes the mind anxious.
Others are always mistrusted. get cheated kidnap They lose their peace of mind because they live in fear.

# 07- Loss

Indeed, he loses it. It is world dharma. According to Atalo Dhamma, everyone loses what they get. Nothing is permanent. Because everything is subject to impermanent dharma, one must face the sorrow of loss.
From the moment the thought of getting something enters the mind, it destroys the peace of mind in seven ways. You have learned through experience that even after receiving it, there is no peace of mind. Because you don't have this understanding, you are all useless.
