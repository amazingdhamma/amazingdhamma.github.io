What is life?

> "Sabbe Dhamma Anatta"

> "Not all dharmas fulfill our will. Cannot be held in our spell. Therefore, there is no essence value in it."

Living is the process of taking in sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and thoughts from our six senses. It is shown in Dharma as seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing.

There are eight dharmas that people have to face when they are in this process. Our Buddha named it Atalo Dharma.

Atalo Dharma is,
Gains and losses, 
insults and praises, 
sorrows and joy, 
great and disgrace. Every living person is subject to this dharma. 

But they hope to get four of these and survive. That is, to enjoy, happiness, gain, praise and greatness.

When they receive grief, loss, insults, humiliation, they suffer unwillingly.
According to the teachings of our great Buddha, no human being can live off of this.
He preached that Atalo Dhamma can be unshaken by understanding the mind that transcends humanity.

Human expects fairness in life. But life is only injustice. It is foolish to seek peace in a troubled life. People who don't know that cry for peace.

In the world there is a just and ideal process. Our Buddha preached karma as the reason. Everything that man gets is according to karma. Not getting something is according to karma. There are consequences according to what one has done and said. It is the law of karma.

We should strive to achieve a saintly life that surpasses karma in understanding the doctrine of reason preached by our great Buddha.

Due to the lack of karma and karmapala, people become tired, confused, and frustrated by clashing with the existing world and getting tired of life. They don't even know that it will bring them many evils.

One should be wise enough to accept what he receives as the best, the most appropriate, and the right thing to receive in life after developing a meritorious mind. It is important to reduce raga, hatred and delusion.

Life is not fantasy. A nasty one. Knowing that, know the reason why and make up your mind to face life beautifully.
