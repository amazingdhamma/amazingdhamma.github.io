Vingghanaya / Vijñāna . (Consciousness)

People who think and create merits and demerits in the most deluded delusion of Avidiya (ignorance) prepare a very appropriate knowledge and experience vingghana (Consciousness) is formed.

when consciousness is formed. At the moment when the chuthi sitha ( emotional mind ) is prepared, the most powerful action is presented.

Anantariya presents itself as meritorious or demerit karma. 

If there is no such, a near karma will arise.
Accordingly, the characteristic features of birth preparation are presented. 

It refers to the Jathi in the Dharma. It's called karmaja Sathwaya. There, the prathisandi chiththa vithiya are set.

Accordingly the atomic creature is created. It is called Sanjathi. (congeniality) 
The atomic creature is formed by the combination of Karmaja, Srutuja, Chittaja , Kaya, ahara (nutitions).

The appropriate method for the birth of the atomic creature thus arranged is decided accordingly. 

As our Buddha preached, there are four ways of birth.
1- The birth of Andaja
2- The birth of Jalabuja
3- The birth of Sansedaja
4- The birth of Opapathika.

Human birth is arranged according to Jalabuja system.   
Pregnancy in the human womb is called Okkanthi. 

The atomic creature takes on a dual nature in the speed with which it moves. Sometimes it takes the form of an atomic molecule and sometimes it takes the form of a wave. It enters the human womb in a wave nature.
It enters the parent's prepared cell. Then it becomes a molecule. Cell proliferation occurs around the atomic creatures.
This is known as descent of Vinghna. (consciousness)

Our Buddha preached about 06 Vinjana.

1- Chakku Vingghana - color vision
2- Sotha Vingghana - hearing sounds
3- Ghana Vingghana - feeling the smell 
4- Jewha Vingghana - Sensation of taste
5- Body touch - touch
6- Mano Vingghana - knowing thoughts.

The body's organs are sent according to the signals received at the moment and are informed about by the Vingghana. (consciousness.)

example -:
When the eye encounters a colored image, no vision occurs. Vision is created when the eye, color image and chakku Vingghana consciousness are combined.
