## Pancha Nivarana

Our great Buddha preached the five gates that close the path to Nirvana, called Pancha Nivarana.

# 03- Uddaccukkucha (Pride)

The fourth door that closes the path to Nirvana is Uddaccukkucha. 

This means the scattered, distracted nature of the mind.

The reason for uddaccukkucha is due to wrong thinking, Misguided.

Because of the scattered nature of the mind, all the actions performed are not correct, so life itself becomes confused. See the results of wrong doing done to oneself and others with a scattered mind through practical experience. The mind that is able to see in this way is able to see the other.

To get rid of the scattered nature of the mind, one should prepare a calm mind that is trained consciously.
Wisely see that everything that is done with an undistracted mind will be successful and the life will be enlightened and it will get high results in the form of happiness.
Our Buddha preaches that the mind that sees the Adinawaya and Anisansa naturally disperses the mind and attains samadhi.
